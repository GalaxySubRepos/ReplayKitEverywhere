## ReplayKit Everywhere  
> Enable screen recording for every app, and activate through Activator  

Support iOS 9  
Not 10, sorry guys, libobjcipc is not compatible  

Note: Video came from ReplayKit may not have the excellent quality, especially audio quality can be kind of bad. But it is still a pretty convenient way to record your screen.   
[Sample Video](https://estertion.win/media/IMG_7069.MP4) ( Recording app: Wonder Parade. Only right channel audio is recorded in this app for no reason )  

Used a lot of codes from [tapthaker/BigShotJb](https://github.com/tapthaker/BigShotJb/). It's a really nice tweak to take long screenshot!
